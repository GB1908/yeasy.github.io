<h2><a name="batch">Make a Batch Process </a></h2>


<p> Here we explain how to finish your graph which was prepared as
described before. A <a href="output.plt"> plot-file "output.plt" </a>
is a saved file at the last part of <a href="plotcalc-e.html">
"Numerical Calculations" </a> section.  This file contains parameters
and functions, some of those are default ones while the other part is
defined by user. In the following list we eliminated the default
lines, and "set terminal" and "plot" lines are folded. </p>

<pre class="file">
#!/usr/local/bin/gnuplot -persist
# set terminal postscript landscape noenhanced monochrome \
#              dashed defaultplex "Helvetica" 14
# set output 'output.ps'
set xlabel "x" 0.000000,0.000000  ""
set ylabel "y=exp(-x)" 0.000000,0.000000  ""

set xrange [ 0 : 2 ] noreverse nowriteback
set yrange [ 0 : 1 ] noreverse nowriteback
set mxtics 5.000000

plot "output.dat" using 1:2 title "Analytical" w l, \
     "output.dat" using 1:3 title "L=1, M=2" w l, \
     "output.dat" using 1:4 title "L=2, M=1" w l
#    EOF
</pre>

<p> At the top of this file you may see the part where an output device
 (Postscript) and file-name are defined. You can draw the same graph
 with this file by using the <tt> load </tt> command. When you make
 another calculation, and the result is stored in "output.dat", you can
 reused this plot-file for the new plotting.</p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; load "output.plt"
</pre>

<p> Alternatively, you can give this file name as a command-line
option when gnuplot is invoked. In this way gnuplot exits after the
last line of the file is read. A graph on your screen disappears at
the same time. To keep the graph on your screen, insert 
<tt> pause -1 </tt> at the end of this file.
 The graph stays there till you hit a 'return' key.</p>


<pre class="sample">
 % gnuplot output.plt
</pre>


<p> A command-line option <tt>-persist</tt> also keeps the graph on
your screen. With this method, gnuplot itself exits but the graph
window settles down. </p>

<pre class="sample">
 % gnuplot -persist output.plt
</pre>

<p> As can be see at the first line of the plot-file, this option is 
already included as a shell script option. This option can be used 
by giving permission of execution to this file, as follows. </p>

<pre class="sample">
 % chmod +x  output.plt
 % ./output.plt
</pre>

<p> With this manner you have to close the window every time. </p>

<p> You can continue your work interactively at the gnuplot
command-line once the plot-file is loaded.  However, a batch-mode
is more convenient. Firstly, insert <tt> pause -1 </tt> at the 
end of the file, then </p>

<ul>
 <li> Edit the plot-file with a text editor
 <li> Browse the graph on a screen
</ul>

<p> Repeat this sequence until you get a satisfactory figure. If you
are aiming at a Postscript file, your sequence may become:</p>

<ul>
 <li> Edit the plot-file with a text editor
 <li> Output the graph in a Postscript data
 <li> Preview it with gv (ghostview)
</ul>

<p> In this case, a comment sign '#' at the beginning of 
<tt> set terminal postscript </tt> and 
<tt> set output 'output.ps'</tt> lines
should be deleted. You don't need <tt> pause </tt> because no drawing
appears on your screen. </p>




<div class="top"><a href="working-e.html#top"><img src="../image/mark-up.png" alt="up"></a></div>
<h2><a name="many">Draw Many Figures </a></h2>

<p> One nice thing to use gnuplot in your scientific activity is that we
 can reuse the plot-file to make a similar figure. We often draw very
 similar figures those have same axis names, same ranges, etc. but the
 numerical data inside the graph are different. With gnuplot you can do
 this by using only one plot-file. To do it, change the data file name
 at <tt>plot "datafile"</tt> or use the same data file name but the file
 is overridden by various data.</p>

<p> Gnuplot batch mode is very useful when you want to make a large
 number of figures at one time. If you are doing this with something
 another software, you have to struggle with your computer until
 midnight. Why don't you make your life easier with gnuplot and some
 UNIX commands to generate many figures within a few seconds.</p>

<p> Here we think about a case that you have many data files ---
 calc1.dat, calc2.dat, calc3.dat --- in your directory, and each file
 contains simple (X,Y) data. Firstly, we make a graph of the data file,
 <a href="calc1.dat"> calc1.dat </a>. Here we define the figure title,
 name of axes, X and Y ranges, and graduations, just like we have done in the
 <a href="plotcalc-e.html"> numerical calculation section. </a></p>

<pre class="file">
set terminal png
set output "calc1.png"
set xlabel "Energy [MeV]"
set ylabel "Cross Section [b]"
set title "(n,2n) reaction"
set xrange [ 0 : 20 ]
set yrange [ 0 : 2 ]
set mxtics 5
set mytics 5
set xtics 5
set ytics 0.5
plot "calc1.dat" using 1:2 notitle w l
</pre>


<p> A PNG image file is generated by gnuplot, when you "feed" this <a
href="data.plt"> data.plt </a> file to gnuplot. If you need an EPS
file, use <tt> set terminal postscript </tt>, and change the name of
output file properly, like calc1.eps.</p>

<pre class="sample">
 % gnuplot &lt; data.plt
</pre>

<div align="center"><img src="calc1.png" alt="calc1.png" width="640" height="480"></div>


<p> Now we reuse this to make a figure of another data file. To do it,
     we have to rewrite the file names "calc1.dat" and "calc1.png" in
     that file.  Unfortunately you cannot use strings-type data in a
     gnuplot command, we <a href="working-e.html#sed">replace the text "calc1" into
     "calc2" with the UNIX command, sed</a>. Alternatively, <a
     href="working-e.html#heredoc"> those file names are give as command line
     options</a> of a shell script.</p>

<hr width="50%">
<p><a name="sed"> The following command changes the text "calc1" in a file 
    into "calc2". </a></p>

<pre class="sample">
 % sed "s/calc1/calc2/g" data.plt | gnuplot
</pre>

<p> This one-line command makes a new figure, calc2.png. You repeat
this for all your data files. When the number of data is not so large,
you can use a shell-loop ('foreach' of csh, or 'for' of sh).</p>

<p> csh, tcsh</p>
<pre class="sample">
 % foreach i (calc2 calc3 calc4 cal5)
 foreach? sed "s/calc1/$i/g" data.plt | gnuplot
 foreach? end
</pre>

<p> sh, bash</p>
<pre class="sample">
 $ for i in calc2 calc3 calc4 cal5 ; do
 &gt; sed "s/calc1/$i/g" data.plt | gnuplot
 &gt; done
</pre>

<p> When you have many files, you can remove the extension '.dat' of
the file name with sed like below. Be careful that there are quotation
and back-quotation marks. The inside sed command is to remove '.dat'
extention of the variable <i> $i </i>, and the outside is to convert
the strings "calc1."</p>

<pre class="sample">
 $ for i in *.dat ; do
 &gt; sed "s/calc1/`echo $i | sed "s/\.dat$//"`/g" data.plt | gnuplot
 &gt; done
</pre>

<p> You can also make a shell script to draw figures one-by-one.
Once you make such a script, you can reuse this for other jobs.
The script contains many lines corresponding to the number of 
your data files.</p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh
sed "s/calc1/calc2/g" data.plt | gnuplot
sed "s/calc1/calc3/g" data.plt | gnuplot
sed "s/calc1/calc4/g" data.plt | gnuplot
sed "s/calc1/calc5/g" data.plt | gnuplot
 ...
</pre>

<p> To make this you can use the UNIX commands, 'ls' and 'awk'. The
following one-line command shows you the list of commands with which
you can make many figures at one time. To make a shell-script file,
re-direct this output to a file (<i> command </i> <tt> &gt; script.sh</tt> ). </p>

<pre class="sample">
 % ls *.dat | awk '{printf("sed \"s/calc1/%s/g\" data.plt | gnuplot\n",$1)}'
</pre>

<br>
<hr width="50%">
<br>


<p> <a name="heredoc">You can write gnuplot commands directly in a shell
 script</a>, and your file name is given as a command line option. To do
 this, use a "here document" of the UNIX shells. In this example, we
 make an EPS file "calc1.eps" from the data file "calc1.dat."</p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh
gnuplot &lt;&lt; EOF
set terminal postscript eps color enhanced
set output "$1.eps"
set xlabel "Energy [MeV]"
set ylabel "Cross Section [b]"
set title "(n,2n) reaction"
set xrange [ 0 : 20 ]
set yrange [ 0 : 2 ]
set mxtics 5
set mytics 5
set xtics 5
set ytics 0.5
plot "$1.dat" using 1:2 notitle w l
EOF
</pre>

<p> As you can see in the example above, the names of data and EPS files
     (without extensions) are replaced by a variable <i>$1</i>.  The
     real names of those variables are given as the command line option
     to this shell script <a href="plot.sh">plot.sh</a>.  This script
     makes the EPS file "calc1.eps" from the data file "calc1.dat" when
     the command is invoked like below.  With this method you can make a
     figure of your data files which are in a different directory, and
     the result is stored in the same directory.</p>

<pre class="sample">
 $ ./plot.sh calc1
</pre>

<p> To change the names of data file and EPS, you replace one of the
     <i>$1</i> variables in the script above into <i>$2</i>, and give
     two command line options to this script.</p>

<p> Finally the next shell script makes it possible to generate many
     figures within a second.</p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh
./plot.sh  calc1
./plot.sh  calc2
./plot.sh  calc3
./plot.sh  calc4
 ...
