<h1><a name="top"> Introduction to gnuplot --- Basic Use  </a></h1>

<p> Since gnuplot has been ported to various operating systems, its
 usage slightly depends on the platform. Here we describe an
 introduction to gnuplot for the case of UNIX, X11. Basically its usage
 is common to those systems, so that this tutorial may be helpful for
 the other operating systems. </p>

<p> First of all, exec gnuplot. Gnuplot displays a banner and credit, then
shows a gnuplot command line prompt <tt>"gnuplot&gt; "</tt>. Gnuplot is 
a command line driven plotting tool. You give commands here to make your 
figure.</p>

        This is gnuplot version 4.0.  Please refer to the documentation
        for command syntax changes.  The old syntax will be accepted
        throughout the 4.0 series, but all save files use the new syntax.

Terminal type set to 'x11'
gnuplot&gt; 
</pre>

<p> At the <tt> "gnuplot&gt; " </tt> prompt you can use the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="basic-e.html#exit">  commands to quit, read a command file, and save parameters </a>
  <li> <a href="basic-e.html#plot">  commands to plot  </a>
  <li> <a href="basic-e.html#set">   commands to change parameters </a>
  <li> <a href="basic-e.html#shell"> commands to execute the shell </a>
  <li> <a href="basic-e.html#var">   commands to define a function, substitute variables, and calculate </a>
</ul>
<p> Actually there are more commands which cannot be categorized into the items
above, so that it is hard to explain everything here. See gnuplot online help by
<tt> help </tt> command.  Here we explain the simplest way to draw a graph with
gnuplot.</p>


<div class="top"><a href="basic-e.html#top"><img src="../image/mark-up.png" alt="up"></a></div>
<h2><a name="exit">Commands to Quit, Read a Command File, and Save Parameters </a></h2>

<p> <tt> exit </tt> or <tt> quit </tt> command terminates gnuplot.
Once you quit gnuplot, all of setting you made will be lost. To save
the current setting, use <tt> save </tt> command followed by a file name in
which parameters and functions you defined are stored. The file name
is quoted by a single or double quotation. The file name is arbitrary, 
but if the same name exists in the current
directory, gnuplot overwrites internal parameters in that file without
any warnings.</p>

<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; save "savefile.plt"
</pre>


<p> <a href="savefile.plt">The saved file</a> is a usual text file. You
 can edit the contents with a text editor. To draw a graph again with
 this file, use the <tt> load "savefile.plt" </tt> command at the
 gnuplot command-line, or execute gnuplot and give the data-file name as
 a command line option.</p>


<p> Inside gnuplot </p>
<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; load "savefile.plt"
</pre>

<p> Outside gnuplot (shell command line) </p>
<pre class="sample">
 % gnuplot savefile.plt
</pre>

<p> The difference of those two methods is: with the <tt>load</tt>
     command you go back to the <tt> gnuplot&gt; </tt> command prompt after
     gnuplot read the file, then you enter the usual interactive
     mode. If you give the data-file name as a command line option (the
     second case), gnuplot ends after it reads the file, and you come
     back to shell. This is a <a href="working-e.html#batch">batch
     mode.</a></p>




<div class="top"><a href="basic-e.html#top"><img src="../image/mark-up.png" alt="up"></a></div>
<h2><a name="plot">Commands to plot </a></h2>

<p> There are two basic commands to plot a graph, <tt> plot </tt> and 
<tt> splot </tt>. The former is used for a 2-dimensional graph,
and the latter is for a 3-dim. Gnuplot makes a graph of any kinds
of functions or numerical data stored in a file. To plot a function,
use the <tt> plot/splot </tt> command with  a range of X-axis 
(or X and Y ranges for 3-dim. plot) and the function. You can omit
the range parameters. Here is an example of plotting y=sin(x), 
which you may often see at many gnuplot tutorials. </p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; plot sin(x)
</pre>

<div align="center"><img src="basic1.png" alt="basic1" width="414" height="332"></div>


<p> This is the 2-dimensional graph gnuplot generates.  The frame is
 drawn by a thick line, which is called "border".  The X and Y axes have
 graduation called "major tics", and numeric labels are written at the
 tics location. The intervals between each major tic can be divided by
 minor tics. You can draw names of X and Y axes. The X-axis name --
 "xlabel" -- is shown below the x-axis border, while the position of
 "ylabel" depends on your terminal. If your terminal can rotate letters,
 the 90-degree rotated ylabel should go to the left of y-axis, otherwise
 it is shown at the top of y-axis.</p>


<p> If ranges of X and Y axes are not specified, gnuplot determines
 appropriate values for those automatically. The example above you can
 see the default X range which is -10 to +10, and the Y range was
 automatically determined. To set the X range 0 to 5, <tt> [0:5]
 </tt>.</p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; plot [0:5] sin(x)
</pre>

<div align="center"><img src="basic2.png" alt="basic2" width="414" height="332"></div>




<div class="top"><a href="basic-e.html#top"><img src="../image/mark-up.png" alt="up"></a></div>
<h2><a name="set">Commands to change variables and parameters</a></h2>

<p> There are a number of parameters which change your plot appearance. 
You can change them by the <tt> set </tt> command. See online help.</p>

<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; help set
 The `set` command can be used to sets _lots_ of options.  No screen is
 drawn, however, until a `plot`, `splot`, or `replot` command is given.

 The `show` command shows their settings;  `show all` shows all the
 settings.

 If a variable contains time/date data, `show` will display it according to
 the format currently defined by `set timefmt`, even if that was not in effect
 when the variable was initially defined.

Subtopics available for set:
      angles         arrow          autoscale      bar
      bmargin        border         boxwidth       clabel
      clip           cntrparam      contour        data
      dgrid3d        dummy          encoding       format
.....
      zero           zeroaxis       zlabel         zmtics
      zrange         ztics
</pre>

<p> Here are several examples to change the parameters. Firstly
insert some text into the xlabel and ylabel. The text should be
quoted by a single or double quotation. Next, specify the range
of X and Y axes. As explained above the X range can be changed if 
you specify that at plotting. Alternatively you can change them
by the "xrange" and "yrange" parameters. </p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; set xlabel "X-AXIS"
gnuplot&gt; set ylabel "Y-AXIS"
gnuplot&gt; set xrange [0:5]
gnuplot&gt; set yrange [-2:2]
gnuplot&gt; plot sin(x)
</pre>

<div align="center"><img src="basic3.png" alt="basic3" width="414" height="332"></div>



<p> If a terminal is not specified, gnuplot makes a graph on your
screen. The <tt> set terminal </tt> command changes the destination of
your plot into a postscript file or printer, etc. Gnuplot
produces a variety of graph by means of various drivers, so that it is
independent of the platforms (but quality of the drawing still depends
of the terminal). The terminals which your gnuplot can handle can be
displayed by the <tt> set terminal </tt> command.</p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; set terminal

Available terminal types:
          unknown  Unknown terminal type - not a plotting device
            table  Dump ASCII table of X Y [Z] values to output
            linux  Linux PC with (s)vgalib
             ....
             tpic  TPIC -- LaTeX picture environment with tpic \specials
         pstricks  LaTeX picture environment with PSTricks macros
          texdraw  LaTeX texdraw environment
               mf  Metafont plotting standard

gnuplot&gt; set terminal postscript
Terminal type set to 'postscript'
Options are 'landscape noenhanced monochrome dashed defaultplex "Helvetica" 14'
</pre>


<p> Gnuplot produces a graph in a Postscript format when <tt> set
terminal postscript </tt> command is given. If an output direction is
not specified, the produced Postscript data flow on your screen. The
<tt> set output </tt> command changes the destination of output. </p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; set output "plot.ps"
gnuplot&gt; plot sin(x)
</pre>




<div class="top"><a href="basic-e.html#top"><img src="../image/mark-up.png" alt="up"></a></div>
<h2><a name="shell">Commands about Shell </a></h2>


<p> You can escape to an interactive shell temporary in which any
shell commands can be used. To spawn a shell, use <tt> shell </tt>
command. To return to gnuplot, use <tt> exit </tt>. A single shell
command can be executed with the ! character at the beginning of the
command, like <tt> ! ls -a </tt>.</p>


<p> Gnuplot supports 'pwd' and 'cd' commands with which you can
display your working directory, or change the directory. The working
directory is your current directory when gnuplot is invoked. To change the
current directory, <tt> cd "../other/dir" </tt>. You need a quotation
mark.</p>




<div class="top"><a href="basic-e.html#top"><img src="../image/mark-up.png" alt="up"></a></div>
<h2><a name="var">Commands for Substitution, Function Definition, Calculations, etc. </a></h2>

<p> You can use gnuplot as a simple calculator. To substitute a value
into a variable, just type "variable = value" at the gnuplot command
line.  To see the value of variable, use <tt> print </tt> command.</p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; a=10
gnuplot&gt; print a
10
</pre>

<p> "Variable = expression" substitutes a calculated value into the 
variable. Double precision is used for the calculation except for 
integer. </p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; a=1+2*sqrt(3)
gnuplot&gt; print log(a)
1.49606798806764
</pre>


<p> The defined variable can be used for the <tt> plot </tt> command. 
Gnuplot holds the circular constant in "pi". To draw a graph of a*sin(x)
from -2pi to +2pi, where a=0.5:</p>


<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; set xrange [-2*pi:2*pi]
gnuplot&gt; a=0.5
gnuplot&gt; plot a*sin(x)
</pre>

<div align="center"><img src="basic4.png" alt="basic4" width="414" height="332"></div>


<p> You can define your own function. For example, to make a function
of f(x)=sin(x)*cos(x), it is defined as: </p>

<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; f(x)=sin(x)*cos(x)
</pre>

<p>The function defined above can be referred to as "f(x)". You can
also include a user-defined variable in your function. </p>

<pre class="sample">
gnuplot&gt; f(x)=a*sin(x)*cos(x)
</pre>

<p> This function contains a variable "a" which is defined by user,
and the function varies with this parameter. </p>
